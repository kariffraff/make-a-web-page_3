      <br><b><em>Procedural Thinking</em></b>
      <br>
      <br>Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.
      <br>
      <br><b><em>Abstract Thinking</em></b>
      <br>
      <br>Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.
      <br>
      <br><b><em>Systematic Debugging</em></b>
      <br>
      <br>Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.
      <br>
      <br><b><em>Technological Empathy</em></b>
      <br>
      <br>Understand the computer as a tool.
      <br>
      <br><b><em>*Systems Thinking*</em></b>-all of the above
      <br>
      <br>Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.
      <br>
      <br><b>This Nanodegree is...</b>
      <br>Organized around a single project: a webpage that will also be your notes for the Nanodegree.
      <br>The project will be broken into 5 stages.
      <br>Each stage has a course associated with it.
      <br>Each course is a collage of content sampled from a variety of classes taught by professional programmers, tech company creators, and university professors.
      <br>I will help you focus on the most important concepts by providing context and occasionally filling in gaps.

      <br><b>Basics of the Web and HTML</b>
      <br>-world wide is web-made up of lots of HTML documents
      <br>-HTML-hypertext markup language (glue)
      <br>-major pieces of web: 1) you, 2) computer (browser), 3) Internet, 4) http, 5) servers
      <br>2) Browser-a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web
      <br>3) Internet-the world's largest computer network
      <br>4) HTTP-main protocol of the web
      <br>5) Servers-computers that host the files that make up the web
      <br>
      <br><b>HTML docs-</b>the heart of the web, made up of:
      <br>-Text content
      <br>-Markup (appearance)
      <br>-References to other documents
      <br>-Links to other pages
      <br>
      <br><b>HTML markup</b>-tags (opening/closing), element (phrase)
      <br><b>-bold </b>
      <br><em>-italic </em>
      <br>
      <br><b>HTML Attributes</b>
      <br>open TAG ATTR="value", close TAG (see hidden code) anchor a-anchors are for making links
      <a href="www.reddit.com">derp</a>
      <br>
      <br><b>Images</b>-img
      <br>img src="url" alt="text" (tag) 
      <br>A Void tag-does not have content and therefore does not need a closing tag, alt is for broken requests/blind ppl
      <br>line break (like enter)-void tag
      <!--<p></p>--> paragraph-line break
      <br>
      <br><b>Whitespace</b>-html does not recognize spaces unless defined
      <br>
      <br><b>Inline vs. block</b> 
      <br>Inline elements
      <br>Block elements--create 'invisible boxes'
      <br>--inline-br
      <br>--block-p
      <br>
      <br><b>Container elements</b>-elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside them
      <br>span-inline
      <br>div-block
      <span class="foo"></span>
      <div class="bar"></div>
      <br><b>CSS-class</b>--a separate language to add styles to docs or controlling how text looks (also JavaScript)

    <div class="lesson">
      <h1 class="article"><b>Lesson 0: </b></h1> 
      <b>1 - What a Web Page is</b>
      <br>
      <br>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
      <br>
      <br><b>2 - How Coding Works</b>
      <br>
      <br>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
      <br>
      <br>I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
      <br>
      <br>look like this:
      <br>
      <br>I'm learning to code!
      <br>
      <br><b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b>
      <br>
      <br>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
      <br>
      <br>For example, if you forget to close a <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.</b>
      <br>
      <br><b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
      <br>
      <br>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
      <br>
      <br><b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
      <br>
      <br>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
      <br>
      <br><b>Tag</b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (b for example) and a closing tag, (<!--</b>-->). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the br tag).
      <br>
      <br><b>Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
      <br>
      <br><b>Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write a href="www.udacity.com" /a

      <br>
      <br>-a website is like your house
      <br>-html files - like structure/wall
      <br>-CSS files - like style/decor
      <br>-Javascript - interactive - like a garage door opener or a tv remote
      <br>
      <br>-HTML and CSS are both "languages" (Hypertext Markup Language/Cascading Style Sheets)
      <br>-HMTL controls the "structure" of a web page
      <br>-CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks)

      <h1 class="article">Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
      <b>How the Web Works</b>
      <br>
      <br>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. 
      <br>
      <br><b>HTML</b>
      <br>
      <br>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". 
      <br>
      <br><b>Tags and Elements</b>
      <br>
      <br>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.
      <br>
      <br><b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
      <br>
      <br>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
      <br>
      <br><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
      <br>
      <br>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h1 class="article"><b>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</b></h1>
      <b>Developer Tools (in the Browser [Google Chrome])</b>
      <br>
      <br>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
      <br>
      <br><b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b>
      <br>
      <br>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... 
      <br>In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
      <br>
      <br><b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b>
      <br>
      <br>When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
      <br>
      <br><b>Text Editors (for programming)</b>
      <br>
      <br>When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

    <div class="lesson">
      <br><b>What is CSS?</b>
      <br>
      <br>CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.
      <br>
      <br><b>How does CSS "control" HTML?</b>
      <br>
      <br>If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a black background and white text, you would write:
      <br>
      <br> h1 {
      <br>  background-color : black;
      <br>  color: white;
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>In this example, the h1 is a <b>selector</b>. It says to the browser "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element."
      <br>
      <br>After the h1 there is a left curly brace { and at the bottom there is a matching right curly brace }. Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted as a "rule" that should be applied to every h1 element.
      <br>
      <br>The line of code that says background-color : black; is a <b>declaration</b>. background-color is a <b>property</b> and black is the <b>value</b> of that property.
      <br>
      <br><b>Selecting by class</b>
      <br>  
      <br>In the example above, we set the background-color of every h1 to black. If we only want to add style to certain h1s, we can use class selectors. Try copying the following code into scratchpad.io to see how this works.
      <br>
    <div class="stop"></div>
    <div class="slow"></div>
    <div class="go"></div>
      <br> (see hidden code for stoplight)
    <!--<div>
    <style>
      div {
        height : 50px;
         width : 50px;
         border-radius: 25px;
     }
    .stop {
      background-color: red;
     }
    .slow {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
    .go {
      background-color: green;
     }
    </style>
    </div>-->    
      <br>We should see a traffic light. Note how in the style element we refer to an HTML element's class name by writing .class-name
      <br>
      <br>Also note how we can apply rules to all divs or just certain divs by using the appropriate selector.
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
      <br><b>How do I include CSS Styling in my web page?</b>
      <br>
      <br>There are three ways you can do this.
      <br>
      <br><b>Method 1: write CSS in the head of your HTML</b>
      <br>
      <br>This method is good for very small projects (like what you'd do in scratchpad.io). To do this: 1. At the top of your HTML document, add a head element. 2. Inside the head element, add a style element. 3. Write your CSS in the style element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.
      <br>
      <br>For example: (see hidden code)
      <br>
      <!--   
        <head>
          <style>
           div {
             background-color : red;
           }
          </style>
        </head>
        <body>
         <div>
          This will have a red background.
          </div>
        </body>-->
      <br><b>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file</b>
      <br>
      <br>This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this: 
      <br>1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html). 
      <br>2. In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code. 
      <br>3. Add a head element to the top of your HTML. 
      <br>4. Add a link tag inside the head element. Since link is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing /link tag. 
      <br>5. Add the following attributes to your link: * rel="stylesheet" * type="text/css" * href="main.css"
      <br>
      <br>For example, you would have a main.html file that looked like this:
        <!--<head>
         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">
        </head>-->
       <br>
          <div>
          This will have a red background. (see hidden code)
          </div>
        and in the same folder you would have a file called main.css like this:
          */
            div {
              background-color : red;
            } */
      <br>
      <br><b>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</b>
      <br>
      <br>This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it. If you want to know more, check out the question and answers in this conversation on Stack Overflow (Stack Overflow is the most widely used programming Q&amp;A community out there).
      <br>
      <br>With this method, you modify the style attributes of every individual HTML element. For example: 
      <br>
      <br>(see hidden code)
      <br>
      <br>
          <div style="background-color: red; color: white">
            This div will have a red background and white text.
          </div>
           <div style="background-color: red; color: white">
            So will this one.
           </div>
           <div style="background-color: red; color: white">
            Now, what if I change my mind?
           </div>
           <div style="background-color: red; color: white">
            I'd rather have a black background...
           </div>
          <div style="background-color: red; color: white">
            Never do this!
          </div>
    </div>
    <span>
      <br>NOTE: there are a lot of little mistakes you can and will at some point make that will cause any of these methods not to work. For example, when I was writing the code for method 2 I had main.html and main.css in different folders on my computer, and it didn't work at all.
      <br>
      <br>As you go through the code, make sure to read all of the code comments that I've added. Comments are lines of text that the computer ignores. They are just there so that programmers can leave notes for other people (or themselves) to read.
      <br>
      <br>In HTML, code comments begin with !-- and -- (see hidden code!) <!-- and end with -->. Everything in between is ignored.
      <br>
      <br>In CSS, code comments begin with /* and end with */.
      <br>

      <h1 class="article">Box Sizing and Positioning Summary</h1>
      <b>Box Sizing</b>
      <br>
      <br>There are four main points that Jessica addressed about box sizing.
      <br>
      <br>1) HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
      <br>2) Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
      <br>3) There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
      <br>-a) Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.
      <br>-b) Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. 
      <br>4) Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.
      <br>
      <br><b>Box Positioning</b>
      <br>1) Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
      <br>2) Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
      <br>
      <br>Process: CODE —> TEST —> REFINE; Developer Tools (Google Chrome browser) can be very helpful
      <br>
      <br><em>REMEMBER:</em>
      <br>1) Look for natural boxes
      <br>2) Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
      <br>3) Write your HTML
      <br>4) Apply styles (from biggest to smallest - i.e. h1 > h2, etc.)
      <br>5) Fix things (look site in other windows, brewers) until looks like design mock
